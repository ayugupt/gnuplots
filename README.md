# gnuplots

This repository contains all plots I have made using gnuplot and the c++ code for parsing and plotting the data. 
I have used a c++ wrapper for gnuplot which is a command line driven plotting software.

For this one I downloaded a shapefile of the world and extracted the points from qgis into a csv file. Then I parsed the extracted data in order to plot 
the map of the world. Then I plotted the map of the world along with the precipitation dataset to generate the map.
